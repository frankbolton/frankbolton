### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I recently completed my PhD in Human Computer Interaction at Tel Aviv University. 
- âš¡ Relocating to the UK soon. Open to interesting offers for roles in data science or biomedical engineering either between Sheffield and Nottingham or global remote-friendly. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about rapidly developing hardware, software and methods to gather good data and provide results with minimal engineering effort. 
- âœ¨ Got frustrated with Israel passport bookings in January 2022, so I reverse engineered the web app API calls and made a simple tool for software minded people to scrape the nearest available bookings [https://github.com/frankbolton/IsraelPassportBooking](https://github.com/frankbolton/IsraelPassportBooking). Functionality has been duplicated elsewhere: [https://github.com/TomerYakir/passportAppointmentFinder](Tomer's implementation) and [https://www.geektime.co.il/israeli-developer-created-a-bot-for-passport-renewal-in-myvisit/](Geektime news). 

Key skills include data analytics and data science, biomedical and electronic R&D, and the professional written and spoken communication that comes with doctoral studies.
